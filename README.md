# Covid-19-Detection-System-using-Chest-X-Ray
<p> Covid-19 has changed our entire world, having been a total menace. In February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) proclaimed it to be pandemic. It was first believed to have emerged from China in December 2019. Covid had a disastrous impact on the entire mankind killing more than half a billion people worldwide. Even developed nations with well-established medical infrastructure were shocked; unable to stop the loss of human life. To date, RTPCR and other tests have been used to identify the illness. However, they take a little longer. Therefore, in order to construct required models utilising the CT scan and chest X-ray images of the affected ones, scientists are applying AI-based approaches. Their objective is to accurately and promptly diagnose the illness. This project is centred on developing an improved model in order to instantly detect covid-19 using chest X-rays with maximum perfection. In this work, a novel 16-layer CNN model is suggested. In our experiment, we used two datasets, the first of which had 224 chest x-ray images and the second of which contained 4626 chest x-ray images. The model's patient categorization accuracy is around 98%. </p>
